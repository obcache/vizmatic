# vizmatic Desktop

vizmatic is a fast, friendly desktop app for assembling social‑ready videos from a set of clips with an optional audio bed. It focuses on simplicity: shuttle controls with a waveform, an intuitive storyboard for sequencing, and one‑click export to MP4.

## Why vizmatic

- Avoid heavyweight editors for simple compilations.
- Work fully offline — no accounts, no uploads.
- Install once, launch from a desktop shortcut, and create.

## What You Can Do

- Load an audio track and preview with Play/Pause and a seek slider.
- Add multiple video files and arrange them by dragging in a color‑coded storyboard.
- Save your project to a portable JSON file and load it later to continue.
- Render to MP4 with a visible progress bar, ETA, and live logs.
- Close safely: if a render is running, choose to stop or cancel; if unsaved changes exist, choose Save, Discard, or Cancel.

## Quick Start (User)

1) Audio
- Click “Browse Audio...” to select a local audio file.

2) Videos
- Click “Browse Videos” and choose your clips. Drag to reorder; click × to remove.

3) Save and Render
